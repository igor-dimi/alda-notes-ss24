An array is a contigious sequence of memory cells. 

## Bounded Arrays 

Bounded arrays have fixed size and are an efficient
data structure.

* Size must be known during compile time and is fixed. 
* Its memory location in the stack allows many compiler
  optimizations.

## Unbounded Arrays

The size of an **unbounded array** can dynamically change
during run-time. From the user POV it provides the same
behaviour as a linked list. 

It allows the operations:

* `pushBack(e: T)`: insert an element at the end of the array
* `popBack(e: T)`: remove an element at the end of the array

### Memory Management

* `allocate(n)`: request a $n$ contigious blocks of memory
  words and returns the address value of the first block.
  This we have the memory blocks:
